# GOT-battles-visualization
This is a data visualization from the battles and deaths data frames from a popular series called Game of Thrones. I have created count plots to see the number of armies of attackers and defenders and to make comparisons. I have also made comparison between the number of deaths and how allegiance played a role in deaths.
